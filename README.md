**Walmart Sales Data Analysis**

Welcome to the Walmart Analysis SQL Project! This dataset has been curated to facilitate an in-depth examination of various aspects of Walmart's operations. 
As one of the largest retail corporations globally, Walmart's data provides a rich resource for SQL analysis, allowing us to explore trends, optimize strategies, and derive valuable insights.

**Purpose of the Project**

The aim of this project is to gain insight into the sales data of Walmart to understand the different factors that affect sales of the different branches.
These objectives aim to guide the SQL-based analysis of Walmart sales data, providing a structured approach to extracting valuable insights and facilitating strategic decision-making for sales optimization.

**List of Analysis **

Sales Trend Analysis:

Investigate historical sales data to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns.
Gain insights into peak sales periods and fluctuations in consumer behavior.

Top-Selling Products-line:

Identify and rank the top-selling products across different categories.
Analyze the performance of these products over time.

Customer Segmentation:

Segment customers based on purchasing behavior, frequency, and average transaction value.
Customize marketing strategies for different customer segments.

**Approach Used**

Time-Series Analysis:

Utilize time-based SQL queries to analyze sales trends over different time intervals (daily, monthly, yearly).
Identify seasonality, recurring patterns, and anomalies in sales data.

Aggregate Functions:

Leverage SQL aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) to calculate total sales, average transaction values, and other key metrics.
Aggregate data for product categories, stores, and regions.

Feature Engineering:

This will help use generate some new columns from existing ones.

Add a new column named time_of_day to give insight of sales in the Morning, Afternoon and Evening. 
This will help answer the question on which part of the day most sales are made.

Add a new column named day_name that contains the extracted days of the week on which the given transaction took place (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). 
This will help answer the question on which week of the day each branch is busiest.

Add a new column named month_name that contains the extracted months of the year on which the given transaction took place (Jan, Feb, Mar). 
Help determine which month of the year has the most sales and profit.

Optimization Recommendations:

Utilize SQL queries to identify areas for optimization, such as stock replenishment strategies, pricing adjustments, or operational improvements.
Provide actionable recommendations based on analysis results.

**Conclusion**

These approaches form a foundation for conducting a comprehensive analysis of Walmart sales data using SQL, 
allowing for a nuanced understanding of various aspects of sales performance and contributing to strategic decision-making.
